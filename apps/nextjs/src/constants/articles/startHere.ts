            body: "Why are you taking a bath? Is it to relax your mind, your body? Are you looking to pamper yourself? Is it remedial, skin care, hair care? To have some time for yourself? To feel sexy?  Sleepy? Relaxed? This will drive the ingredients of your bath. However, if your intention is to actually cleanse your skin, I would suggest showering before your bath. As lovely and cleansing as baths are, they are not meant for heavy-duty dirt and sweat removal, or even shaving, and you might leave feeling dirtier than when you got in.",

            heading: "2. Gather your tools",
            body: "The things that you need for your bath to achieve your purpose, grab them. If your goal is to relax muscles, you might want to use bath salts. If it’s to hydrate your skin, bath oils. Maybe you want some bubbles, maybe a bath bomb, maybe hair or face masks, washes. Even herbs and flower petals if you want a more natural feel to the bath. You’ll also want a towel, to dry your hands at a moments notice.",

            body: "Soft lighting, such as with candles set around the bath, are nice, or anything that emits a soft glow. However, if your bathroom is like mine and gets too steamy for comfort, you might not have option to turn off the main bathroom light to enjoy this glow. Instead, consider creating some sort of alter around your sink or on your bath caddy with the oils, lotions, and elixirs you will be using set out in a pleasing way. A little attention to detail goes a long way. I personally have a poster and a party banner from Lush that says “Happy Bathday” hanging on the walls around my tub. If you like crystals, you can also take some crystals to your bath, provided they don’t react poorly with water (as some salts will do).",

            heading: "4. Scents",
            body: "If candles are part of your lighting, make sure they are either scentless or match the scents you are using in the rest of your bath. I personally don’t think the aromas ever mix in a bad way, but perhaps you really want to focus on relaxation and using lavender as your scent. Perhaps your want fresh and fruity, and so sandalwood would ruin your vibe. If you aren’t using candles and want to add some scents, you can consider lighting incense, essential oil diffusers (some of which can also serve as part of your lighting), or even adding a few drops of essential oil directly into the bath water itself.",

            body: "You want to bring a big water bottle to the bath, but also a “treat yourself” drink that matches your intention, whether it’s tea, juice, soda, or a cocktail. I like sparkling coconut water while my boyfriend usually takes a whiskey or a gin and tonic.",

            body: "There are no rules. You are adult and if you want to bring a pizza to the bath, and that will make you happy, do it. I usually opt for fruit or chocolate, but I have brought bags of chips, popcorn, or even burgers. It’s your bath, do what makes you happy. Just maybe be careful of dropping things into the water.",

            body: "You can definitely just sit in the bath and meditate, but if that doesn’t align with your goal or you can’t do it for more than a few minutes, bring a book. Or a magazine. Or watch a movie or tv show on your iPad. Scroll through TikTok. Listen to a podcast. As long as it aligns with your goal and makes you happy.",
